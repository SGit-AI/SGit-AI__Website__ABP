# v0.10.0: the desktop walkthrough: an assistant on your own machine, the map of what matters on it, and the rules that open with the map; plus the article for v0.9.0

The third walkthrough, in the same four steps as the mailbox and cost ones because the deployer asked for the workflow to always be the same: find out what is going on, then write the rules that let the agent decide better for itself. On a machine the word host means the machine, and the published shape's character is that reading files, changing them and running commands each sit at a setting the account can flip. The concept the section is built on is the deployer's: what is being given to the agent is context on what is important and what is not, so step two produces a map of the machine in four groups, the work, the not-yours, the credentials and the record, and step three's rules open with that map rather than with prohibitions. The release also carries the article for v0.9.0.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Version | `v0.10.0` |
| Date | 2026-09-22 |
| Commit | **`git rev-list -n 1 v0.10.0`**. The tag is the record: CI derives it from `admin/build/version.txt` and creates it on the commit whose subject carries `site v0.10.0:`. The hash is not written into [`versions/v0.10.0.json`](../../versions/v0.10.0.json), because a release commit cannot contain its own hash and reading it back from the tag made the build produce different bytes on a checkout with tags than on one without. |
| Reconstructed | no |
| Machine readable | [`versions/v0.10.0.json`](../../versions/v0.10.0.json) |

## What changed

- Five pages at /desktop/: a hub and four steps, the same shape as the other two walkthroughs, with the shape's own grant table on the hub and every number computed from the derived profile.
- Ten prompts: what is switched on right now; what it has already reached; what it cannot tell about its own reach; the map of the machine in four groups; what in the record must never come back, written as a one time read on purpose; freely, ask first and never; four lines; the full rules opening with the map, each rule naming the group it follows from; grade your own rules; and what on the machine would actually bound it.
- The fourth page applies the enforcer test to a switch: the same toggle is a setting on your own laptop and a boundary on a managed one, because on the managed one somebody else holds it.
- The article for v0.9.0, the thirteenth in the section, with six screenshots captured from the v0.9.0 tag.

## What it was built against

- The derived profile for a desktop application with local tools, 0 of 11 rows measured, four of them at a setting.
- The deployer's voice memo of 22 September 2026: the same sequence for the desktop product, two sets of items, and the concept of context on what matters.
- The estate case estate-002, whose desktop deployment has no shape and whose clauses this walkthrough generalises.

## The five verifications against the sibling

The pipeline, the release gate and the page shell were copied from [SGit-AI__Website__Game__What-Can-It-Do](https://github.com/SGit-AI/SGit-AI__Website__Game__What-Can-It-Do) at its v0.8.0. The conventions ask for five things to be verified rather than assumed, and **an absent one is a finding that belongs in the first version's notes** rather than a thing to fix quietly.

| Verification | The sibling | What this repository does |
|---|---|---|
| The tag is derived from the version file, not typed by hand | **holds** | `admin/build/version.txt` owns the version. CI reads it, refuses to tag if the newest release commit's subject disagrees, refuses if the tag already exists on an earlier commit, and refuses if the bump is not the next minor or a deliberate major. Copied unchanged. |
| The build fails when `llms.txt` does not list every page | **did not hold** | The sibling generates `llms.txt` from its page list, so it cannot miss a page the generator knows about, and nothing fails if a page exists in the tree that the generator does not. Check 11 here walks the tree and fails on any `.html` page missing from `llms.txt`. |
| The custom domain survives a rebuild | **did not hold** | The sibling commits `CNAME` once. Here the build writes it from `SITE['host']`, and the canonical check reads the same file, so a domain change is one edit in one place. |
| The markdown twin of every page is produced by the build | **holds** | `shell.write_site` emits the `.html` and the `.md` from the same block list, and gate check 7 fails on a page without a twin. Copied unchanged, and it is the reason the twins cannot drift. |
| The version in the chrome comes from `versions/index.json` | **did not hold** | The sibling has no `versions/index.json` at all: the badge reads `version.txt` and links to a hand-maintained history page. Here the build generates `versions/index.json`, a file and a page per version, from the same string the tag is derived from, and the badge links to that version's own details. The published pipeline still owns the tag, so the two cannot disagree. |

**Two of the three that did not hold are one-line fixes and the third is a surface that did not exist.** None of them is a criticism of a site that has been publishing for weeks: they are the cost of a pipeline growing by copy, which is exactly what the five verifications are for.

## Where the sources disagree

The published source wins and the disagreement is recorded. **The estate's method is to record the gap, not to quietly resolve it.**

| The disagreement | What each says | What this site did |
|---|---|---|
| SETTLED IN v0.2.0. The foundation document and the project lead, on whether a delta is stored | v0.1.0 built to the foundation document's rule that the delta is computed and NEVER STORED, and put a check in the release gate refusing any file that carried one. The project lead's correction, issued the same day, is that the second half was an error: the delta belongs in a vault along with the history of the grants and mandates that produced it. | v0.2.0 stores the deltas with their inputs pinned and inverts the check, so the gate now recomputes every one of them. **Never authored** is the rule that replaced it, and it is harder than the one it replaced. See [the delta](../../model/delta/index.md). |
| The foundation document and the published data, on what changes when confirmations go off | The foundation document says that turning confirmations off moves the barrier on **every capability in the delta** by one row. In the published pack it moves exactly one barrier, on `execute.process.host`, and that capability is **inside the mandate**: the deployer asked for it. So the label's numbers do not move at all and the two documents still differ materially. | The data wins on the fact and the foundation document wins on the wording, so both example pages state what actually changes. It makes the pair a **better** argument, not a worse one: identical headline numbers, a materially different document, which is the case for the leaflet and against any single number. |
| The pack and the sibling, on where the version lives | The conventions ask for `versions/index.json` as the home of the version. The sibling's working pipeline derives the tag from `admin/build/version.txt` and has no `versions/index.json`. | Both. `version.txt` still owns the tag, because that is the published pipeline and it wins; `versions/index.json` is generated from the same string, so the surface the guidance asks for exists and cannot drift from the tag. The gate checks the agreement. |
| The pack and the published data, on whether the smallest grant has an empty delta | The pack says the smallest shape in the set is where a reader who does not believe an agent can do much *finds the delta is still not empty*. In the published data that shape's grant is one capability and the starting mandate asks for exactly it, so **the delta is empty**. | The example says so, plainly, and says why an empty delta is a result rather than a failure: a method that could never report nothing would be a sales document, and the other four examples would be worth less for it. Changing the mandate to manufacture a delta would have been the dishonest fix. |
| The published headline and the pack's own vocabulary, on what `measured' means | The map's headline says 21 of 99 rows were measured. The pack's vocabulary defines `measured` as a dated probe with an evidence file, and **no row in the pack is at that tier**: the 21 are at `observed`, which is seen directly on the thing itself. | The site counts `observed` as measured, which reproduces the published figure, and says so in `data/provenance.json` and on the data page. Reproducing the number without the note would have been less careful than the map. |
| The hard rules and the published data, on em dashes and pure ASCII | Every document in this repository is to be pure ASCII, with zero em dashes and zero en dashes. The data promoted from the capability map carries all three, because it was written elsewhere and this site does not get to edit somebody else's bytes. | Both. The JSON keeps the upstream strings exactly as they arrived and `data/` is exempt from the guard for that reason; every upstream string rendered into a page is transliterated at render time; and the bytes are one click away under `/data/upstream/`. The guard is in the pipeline and fails the build everywhere else. |
| The guidance and the docs section, on rebuilding the markdown renderer | The guidance forbids rebuilding markdown viewing, file trees and page layouts, because the platform provides them. The docs section has to turn eleven markdown documents into pages. | `admin/build/docs_pages.py` translates a markdown document into the same small block vocabulary every other page here is written in, at build time. No viewer is shipped to a browser, no file tree and no layout engine, and the source bytes are served beside every rendered document. It is a judgement call and it is recorded as one rather than assumed. |

## What is not built yet, stated plainly

- **No view across the nine shapes.** Each example carries a grant-against-mandate figure, and there is no figure that puts one capability across every deployment shape at once. The third graph rule says render the result of a query rather than the whole graph, so that would be another query rather than a map.
- **No ABP for a shape outside the published map**, which means the cost of producing one where the grant has to be measured rather than looked up is still unknown, and that is the number the store needs.
- **No interchange form emitted.** The W3C vocabulary is described on [the graph page](../../model/graph/index.md) and nothing on this site serialises to it yet.
- **Quantity and agent-to-agent interaction are not modelled**, as the model page says. They are gaps in the ontology rather than in this site.
